            <h2>Perspective</h2>
                <p>The colors of objects appear to change depending on how near or far they are from you, because of atmospheric conditions. In the foreground, colors are at their warmest and strongest and have the widest range of 
                   tones. With distance, colors lose their intensity, becoming bluer and lighter with less tonal variation. To create 
                   a sense of perspective in your paintings, forget what color you think an object is and paint it the color you 
                   actually see. This will be determined by how near or far away the object is.
